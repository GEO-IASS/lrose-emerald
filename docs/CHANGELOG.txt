  * Includes improvements to Netcdf library.

  * Modified parameter handing to allow for fields in structures to
    be handled.  

  * Fixed a bug in config file usage (was silently ignored)
    

** Version 20150326
 
  * Now works on Matlab 2014b+

  * Updated Documentation

  * Default renderer is now to use zbuffer

  * Fixed a problem where PPI's and RHI's would fail to plot for
    moving platforms.

  * Added a routine to print out diagnostics

  * Added ability in the API to replace a dataset, or add a dataset
    somewhere other than at the end of the databuffer.

** Version 20150310
 
  * Updated underlying approach to getting data info to the
    datacursor.  This is in preparation for handingling different
    colorscales in an upcoming update.

  * Added RHIs

  * Now can modify a dataset (Sweep).  CUrrently the only
    functionality is to apply a mask (i.e. censor using some
    thresholding condition).

  * Can delete datasets without deleting entire buffer.

  * Can now specify particular fields to display when using the
    datacursor.  

  * Can now same data from polygon into a workspace variable.

  * Added more statistics to polygon histograms.

  * Added dataset index to title string.


** Version 20150302
 
  * Now properly handles cases where the number of moments available
    is less than the number of plot panels.

  * Now the default is to only load 1 file at a time.  You can turn
    this back on by overriding the data_load.MultiSelect option.
    Problem is that current software assumes all files loaded at the
    same time have the same structure.  This will be fixed later to be
    smarter about this.

  * When loading, cartesian coordinates are computed to same time
    during normal plotting.

  * Added ability to change the error function.  e.g. matlab's "error"
    or "errordlg".  Controled using config or override options.

  * Added an api example.

  * Fixed case sensivity issues of Matlab properties (Thanks to Paul Hein)


** Version 20131017

  * Fixed error when using the menu to quit.

  * Builds are now including the directory: emerald-VERSION

** Version 20131016
  
  * Fixed axes on BSCANS so that the x is time from sweep start and
    the y is range

  * If the pointing angle is downward on a BSCAN, the y direction is
    flipped.


** Version 20131010
